                                    The term PEST has been used in marketing and business over the last 20 years and
                                    its true history is difficult to establish. The earliest known reference for
                                    “Scanning the Business Environment” appears to be made by Francis J. Aguilarin 1967
                                    who discusses about the “ETPS”, which is a mnemonic for the four sectors that
                                    impact his business’ environment: Economic, Technical, Political, and Social. Some
                                    time after its publication, Arnold Brownreorganized it as “STEP” for Strategic
                                    Trend Evaluation Process, as a way to organise the results of his environmental
                                    scanning. Thereafter, this “macro external environment analysis” was modified again
                                    to become the “STEPE” analysis (Social, Technical, Economic, Political, and
                                    Ecological).
                                    During the 1980s, several other authors (such as Fahey, Narayanan, Morrison,
                                    Renfro, Boucher, Meccaand Porter) included variations in the orders of the letters:
                                    PEST, PESTLE, STEEPLE etc. But there is no order or priority in any of the formats.
                                    Now the term PESTLEis well-know worldwide and is popular on Human Resources and in
                                    introduction to marketing courses. The framework still knows modifications and
                                    alterations, some of the most famous professor in Marketing have already added
                                    certain complementary words like an E for Ethics. It adds the element of
                                    Demographics while making research on the market.

                                        The PESTLE Framework is designed as a business environmental scan. The goal is
                                        to get as much information as possible that may influence a business, it’s
                                        important to be aware of every factor to establish the strategy planning. It
                                        gives a bird’s eye view of the whole environment from different angles. The
                                        final idea is to provide safety to whom want to follow an idea, a plan or a
                                        project.

                                        All the aspects of this technique are crucial for any business. It’s more than
                                        just understanding the market; this framework is one key feature to understand
                                        strategic management. It’s not only defining what a company should do, but also
                                        help to set up goals regarding the overall strategy. It’s crucial to understand
                                        that each factors may have different meaning to different kinds of industries
                                        or specialities. But it’s still imperative to any company who wants to develop
                                        something new (product, service, technic, etc.). They have to conduct the
                                        PESTLE analysiswhich go deeper in different fields than theSWOT analysis.
